A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard or indeed almost anything.</description></item><item><title>Shaper</title><link>https://cloudseeder.github.io/acme-corp/news/shaper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://cloudseeder.github.io/acme-corp/news/shaper/</guid><description>Drawing is a form of visual art in which a person uses various drawing instruments to mark paper or another two-dimensional medium.
