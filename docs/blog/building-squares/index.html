In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or (100-gradian angles or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD."><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png href=https://cloudseeder.github.io/acme-corp/image/favicon_hue010d4fad590a87d325b7e07b2e61f59_2460_cba3c0f49a165eb4180302fa5afe537c.png><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=https://cloudseeder.github.io/acme-corp/index.min.css><title>Square</title><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://cloudseeder.github.io/acme-corp/blog/building-squares/cover.jpg"><meta name=twitter:title content="Square"><meta name=twitter:description content="Squares for just

There are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 (through 90°, 180° and 270°).

It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius.
